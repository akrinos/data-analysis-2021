# Welcome to the 2021 Data Analysis refresher course!

## Using this repository as a binder

I have implemented the course materials this year as a binder that hosts a Jupyter notebook. You can use the widget below to launch the binder:

## Cloning the repository the old-fashioned way

In order to clone this repository to use it locally (which will give you access to all the required data, but you will need to use `pip` to install software dependencies, if you do not already have them), execute:

```
git clone https://github.com/akrinos/data-analysis-2021
```

from the command line, using the terminal emulator of your choice.
